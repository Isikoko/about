        <center><h1>About me page</h1></center>
       <p>I am Ogunnaike Isiwat Oriola,from Ogun State but residing in Ibadan. I am a student at Altschoolafrica with student id ALT/SOE/023/2289 
           enrolled in a one-year course to earn a Diploma in Frontend Engineering.

        In addition to being a student, I am a professional UI/UX designer currently working full time. I describe myself as an inquisitive and dedicated 
        individual, always eager to learn and take on new challenges. My design background has endowed me with a unique perspective on problem-solving.
        
        Venturing into Frontend Engineering, I am thrilled to combine my creative expertise with the technical intricacies of bbeing a product designer. 
        This transition represents a new chapter in my journey, merging my design foundation with the dynamic world of coding.
        
        If you have any questions or if there's anything specific you'd like to discuss, feel free to let me know. I'm here to help and support you in your endeavors.</p>
<center><h2>Why i joined Altschoolafrica</h2></center>
<p>As a ui/ux designer, you need a little bit of coding skills. It's not necessary but it has an added advantage that it gives to your cv. I joined altschool for that edge 
    that it gives.Also because coding seems fun. Learning frontend also empowers me as an UI/UX designer to implement my designs directly. This control ensures that the final 
    product closely aligns with the original vision, and i can make real-time adjustments based on user interface interactions.</p
